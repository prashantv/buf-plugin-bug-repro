To use\nthese features, you must sign up in advance and sign a Trusted Tester\nagreement (which includes confidentiality provisions). These features may\nbe unstable, changed in backward-incompatible ways, and are not\nguaranteed to be released.\n - ALPHA: Alpha is a limited availability test for releases before they are cleared\nfor widespread use. By Alpha, all significant design issues are resolved\nand we are in the process of verifying functionality. Alpha customers\nneed to apply for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their\nprojects allowlisted. Alpha releases don't have to be feature complete,\nno SLAs are provided, and there are no technical support obligations, but\nthey will be far enough along that customers can actually use them in\ntest environments or for limited-use tests -- just like they would in\nnormal production cases.\n - BETA: Beta is the point at which we are ready to open a release for any\ncustomer to use. There are no SLA or technical support obligations in a\nBeta release. Products will be complete from a feature perspective, but\nmay have some open outstanding issues. Beta releases are suitable for\nlimited production use cases.\n - GA: GA features are open to all developers and are considered stable and\nfully qualified for production use.\n - DEPRECATED: Deprecated features are scheduled to be shut down and removed.
